# kubquizz
This is a training small quizz application aimed add avaluating students around their knowledge on docker, kubernetes.

The idea is to test student ability so create a small kubernetes client quizz application,
then to load the kubernetes quizz from the client application
... and to execute the quizz.

The application is separated in two part:
- a frontent quizz application that get quizz questions from a server side deployed in the CLoud
- a backend application delivering quizz and storing :
  - student quizz answer
  - student frontend quizz environment as we evaluate also the frontend deployment quality ... :-)
  
  Have fun !
